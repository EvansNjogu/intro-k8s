# Welcome & Introduction

## Welcome to LFS158x

Is your team beginning to use Kubernetes for container orchestration? Do you need guidelines on how to start transforming your organization with Kubernetes and cloud-native patterns? Would you like to simplify software container orchestration and find a way to grow your use of Kubernetes without adding infrastructure complexity? Then this is the course for you!

In this course, we will discuss some of Kubernetes' basic concepts and talk about the architecture of the system, the problems it solves, and the model that it uses to handle containerized deployments and scaling.

This course offers an introduction to Kubernetes and includes technical instructions on how to deploy a stand-alone and multi-tier application. You will learn about ConfigMaps and Secrets, and how to use Ingress.

Upon completion, developers will have a solid understanding of the origin, architecture and building blocks for Kubernetes, and will be able to begin testing the new cloud-native pattern to begin the cloud-native journey.

## Course Learning Objectives

By taking this course, you will learn the following:

- The origin, architecture, primary components, and building blocks of Kubernetes.
- How to set up and access a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
- Ways to run applications on the deployed Kubernetes environment, and access the deployed applications.
- The usefulness of Kubernetes communities, and how you can participate.

## Before You Begin

Image of a button with the word Help typed on itIf you are using edX for the first time, we strongly encourage you to start by taking a free 'how to use edX' course that the team at edX has made available. [Click here](https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038) to register and you will be on your way. You will find the edX platform simple and intuitive. You can use the _Table of Content_ under the Course tab to navigate between _Chapters_ and _Sections_. Once you are in a chapter/section, you can use the ribbon at the top of the screen to navigate the units within that _Section_ or _Chapter_. You can always go back to the _Table of Contents_ by clicking on the Course in the ribbon.

This course is self-paced, meaning there is no structured instructor availability. However, you will find the Discussion board (see the **Discussion** tab at the top of each page) to be very helpful, as a means of asking or answering questions and interacting with your peers taking the course. The Discussion board is moderated by The Linux Foundation.
For any technical issues with the edX platform (including login problems and issues with the Verified Certificate), please use the **Help** icon located on the upper right side of your screen.

## Syllabus and Grading

The outline for this course can be downloaded [here](). Since this course is entirely self-paced, we include demos and questions to help you practice the skills as you are acquiring them. At the end of each chapter, you will have a set of graded knowledge check questions, that are meant to further check your understanding of the material presented. The grades obtained by answering these knowledge check questions will represent 20% of your final grade.

At the end of the course, you are required to pass a final exam, which consists of 30 questions. The remaining 80% of your final grade is represented by the score obtained in the final exam.

In order to complete this course with a passing grade, you must obtain a passing score (Knowledge Check and Final Exam) of minimum 70%.

You will have a maximum of 2 attempts to answer each question on the exam (other than true/false answers, in which case, you have only 1 attempt). It is an open book exam (meaning that you are free to reference your notes, screens from the course, etc.), and there is no time limit on how long you can spend on a question. You can always skip a question and come back to it later.

**Getting your Certificate of Completion**

If you are enrolled in a Verified track, Verified Certificates of completion are available once you achieve a passing score on the final exam. Once you have earned an overall grade of 70% or higher, you will be able to request your certificate directly from your Progress page. Once the request is completed (which may take up to 48 hours), you can then return to the same place and download your certificate. There are no certificates available for Audit tracks.

## Course Timing

This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material.

## Course Progress and Completion

The goal of this course is to help you grasp the basics of Kubernetes. As a result, there are many opportunities to check your understanding using the Knowledge Check questions at the end of each chapter. Please keep in mind that the Knowledge Check questions are graded, and, as such, they do count towards your final passing grade (they represent 20% of your final grade).

The Final Exam represents 80% of your passing grade. Once you complete the exam, you will want to know if you have passed. You will be able to see your completion status using the "Progress" tab at the top of your screen, which will clearly indicate whether or not you have achieved a passing score. Click here to view a sample of this screen in a new tab.

Certificates of completion (Verified Certificates) are available once you achieve a passing score of 70% on your course. Once you have done so, you can request the certificate on your "Progress" page. Once the request is completed (which may take up to 48 hours), you can then return to the same place and download your certificate. The visuals below provide a guide to what this will look like.

## Guidelines to Discussions

One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the Discussion boards. These boards can be used in the following ways:

- To discuss concepts, tools, and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course material.
- To ask questions about course content.
- To share resources and ideas related to cloud computing and technologies.

We strongly encourage you not only to ask questions, but to share with your peers opinions about the course content, as well as valuable related resources. The Discussion boards will be reviewed periodically by The Linux Foundation staff, but it is primarily a community resource. To learn more tips about using the Discussion boards, click [here](http://blog.edx.org/getting-most-out-edx-discussion-forums).

## Learning Aids

This course uses several types of learning aids to enhance your learning experience.
Videos

This course has numerous videos, in which the instructor explains the concepts and principles of Kubernetes. You may want to click on the CC button to see closed captioning. Click [here](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS151.x+2T2016+type@asset+block@Welcome_Chapter_Video_screencapture.jpg) to see additional hints.

**External Resources**

You will also have numerous opportunities to expand your knowledge of Kubernetes by accessing the external hyperlinks we provide throughout the entire course.

**Check Your Understanding**

At the end of each chapter, you will find a series of Knowledge Check questions. These questions, just like the demos, were designed with one main goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce what you have learned. It is important to point out that the **knowledge check questions are graded and they count towards your passing grade**. We would like to emphasize as well that **you will be required to take a final exam to complete this course**.
